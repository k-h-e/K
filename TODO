- IO::StreamBuffer: in ReadWrite mode, fill-truncation of last Flush() appears to not be working (tested with EchoApp lake download).
- InteractionConnectionEndPoint
    - limit buffer size for outgoing data
    - configure size constraint for dispatched data?
- Framework::Connection::Register(): document!
- Optionally write outgoing buffered data when connections get destroyed? -> BufferedConnection, framework connection.
- IO::IO::NotifyWorker() is void, uses assert. Better solution?
- Check everywhere regarding default move operations!
